## Use Case
The purpose of this single page site is to have the abilty to direct colleagues or potential employers to a digital CV that will clearly outline my skills, experience and strengths. The site is deliberately designed with all content on a single page as it simulates a classic document style CV.

## News
The site is currently being redeveloped using the Bootstrap framework. This will enable cleaner responsiveness and ultimately far less CSS development. The development of this project can be found under the 'bootstrap' branch.

## Improvements & Next Steps
* The next stage in the development of this project would be to migrate this single page site into a custom theme of a content management system, for example; Wordpress or Drupal. This would then allow me to create a dynamic navigation menu with managed pages. The benefits of this development would be to seemlessly add/remove/modify the content.
* To add a sticky navigation menu that scrolls the page up and down to the different sections.
* To create and add a custom favicon to the site.
* To complete the migration to the Bootstrap framework.
* To make greater use of available font vector icons.
