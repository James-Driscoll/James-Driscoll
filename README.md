# james-driscoll.co.uk

james-driscoll.co.uk is a signle page site to professionally describe my qualifications, work experience and interest.

## Use Case
The purpose of this single page site is to have the abilty to direct colleagues or potential employers to a digital CV site that will clearly outline my skills, experience and strengths. The site is deliberately designed with all content on a single page as it simulates a classic document style CV.

## Improvements
* The next stage in the development of this project would be to migrate this single page site in a custom theme of a content management system, for example; Wordpress or Drupal. This would then allow me to create a dynamic navigation menu with managed pages. The benefits of this development would be to seemlessly add/remove/modify the content.
* To split the different sections into differnet pages, with a navigation menu to navigate through the pages. This would increase my ability to track each specific section, ultimiately giving me greater visibility of the most read sections.
