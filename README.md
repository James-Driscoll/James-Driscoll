# james-driscoll.co.uk

james-driscoll.co.uk is a single page site to professionally describe my qualifications, work experience and interests.

## Use Case
The purpose of this single page site is to have the abilty to direct colleagues or potential employers to a digital CV that will clearly outline my skills, experience and strengths. The site is deliberately designed with all content on a single page as it simulates a classic document style CV.

## Access
* Source Code: [https://github.com/James-Driscoll/James-Driscoll.git](https://github.com/James-Driscoll/James-Driscoll.git)
* Homepage: [james-driscoll.co.uk](http://james-driscoll.co.uk)

## Improvements
* The next stage in the development of this project would be to migrate this single page site into a custom theme of a content management system, for example; Wordpress or Drupal. This would then allow me to create a dynamic navigation menu with managed pages. The benefits of this development would be to seemlessly add/remove/modify the content.

* To split the different sections into differnet pages, with a navigation menu to direct users through the pages. This would increase my ability to track each specific section, ultimiately giving me greater visibility of the most read sections.

* To create and add a custom favicon to the site.
