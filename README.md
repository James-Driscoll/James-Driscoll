# jamesdriscoll.london

jamesdriscoll.london is a single page website to professionally describe my qualifications, work experience and interests. A digital CV.

## Use Case
The purpose of this single page site is to have the abilty to direct colleagues or potential employers to a digital CV that will clearly outline my skills, experience and strengths. The site is deliberately designed with all content on a single page as it simulates a classic document style CV.

The site is front-end responsive, styled using CSS media queries.

## Improvements & Next Steps
* The next stage in the development of this project would be to migrate this single page site into a custom theme of a content management system, for example; Wordpress or Drupal. This would then allow me to create a dynamic navigation menu with managed pages. The benefits of this development would be to seemlessly add/remove/modify the content.
* To add a sticky navigation menu that scrolls the page up and down to the different sections.

* To create and add a custom favicon to the site.
